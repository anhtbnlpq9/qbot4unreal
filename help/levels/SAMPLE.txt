This file uses tags to determine which level (no authed, authed, staff, ...) has access to which commands.
Lines can begin with:
 - comment tag: line begin with // => this line is never printed
 - level-less: the line begins directly) => this line will be printed whatever the level
 - level-ful: <LEVEL>!<LINE> => this line will be printed if the user has access level
                                note that access level can be a combination of several levels
                                (an user could be authed and oper)
Current levels:
000 = unauth user
050 = authed user
100 = staff member
150 = oper member
200 = admin member
900 = developper member
950 = debug member


This line is always printed
//This line is never printed
050!This line is printed to authed users only
