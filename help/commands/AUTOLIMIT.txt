Usage: AUTOLIMIT <channel> [<threshold>]
The autolimit feature maintains a user limit (+l) on the channel which is
regularly updated to keep a fixed number of spaces free on the channel for
people to join.  This is useful since it prevents a large number of "clones"
joining at the same time.  However, if the number of free spaces is too small
it's possible that legitimate users won't be able to join.  This command allows
you to adjust the number of free spaces to maintain when autolimit is enabled.  
To actually turn the autolimit feature on or off, see CHANFLAGS.  Where:
 * channel   - the channel to use.
 * threshold - specifies the new threshold.  If not specified, the current threshold 
               is displayed.
Viewing the current threshold requires operator (+o) access on the named channel.
Updating the threshold requires master (+m) access on the named channel.
