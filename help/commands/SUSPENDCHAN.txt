Usage: SUSPEND <channel> <reason>
Suspends a channel where:
 channel - channel to suspend
 reason  - reason for suspension
This will set the chanflags to +z-j. The bot will
leave the channel and the channel will appear unregistered.
While the channel is suspended, it is not possible to change
the channel parameters such as CHANLEV, CHANFLAGS, ... or 
commands that would involve actions on the channel (e.g. REJOIN),
however it is still possible to read those parameters (for
the staff, users will not have access to read the information).
Also, while the channel is suspended, it is not possible to 
use REQUESTBOT/ADDCHAN on it, nor that the bot will perform any
action on the channel (bans, AUTOLIMIT, etc.)
End of help.
