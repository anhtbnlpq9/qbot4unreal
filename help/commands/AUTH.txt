Usage: AUTH <username> <password>
Authenticates you on the bot, where:
 * username - your username
 * password - your password
If you do not have a username and password, see HELLO.
Note: when you AUTH on the bot, it will apply your CHANLEV flags for
      every channel you are on, as if you would join them.
